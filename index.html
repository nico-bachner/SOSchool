                <h2>About Our Initiative</h2>
                <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                <p>We are a team of young people aged 16 to 19. We aspire to be as friendly, motivated and dynamic as possible. We love to learn and share our interest in studying</p>
                <h3>Who are our pupils?</h3>
                <p>Our classes are aimed at children in difficulty or children who had difficulties to study during the lock down. In collaboration with Caritas and the Luxembourg Red Cross, we currently support children from various families.</p>
                <h3>Our teaching methods</h3>
                <p>Because we are convinced that curiosity and self-confidence are very important to succeed in getting good marks, we are committed to building confidence and encouraging them. We invest ourselves fully and help the children every week, at their home, not only by identifying areas of progress, by doing substantive revisions, but we also assist them in their homework. When possible, we get in touch with the teacher to develop a work plan. We also speak regularly with parents to involve them in their child's progress.</p>
                <h3>Price</h3>
                <p>It's 100% free! Everything we do, we do as a service to society, without any form of monetary incentive.</p>
