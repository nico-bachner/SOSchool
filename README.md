# SOSchool

[sos school](https://www.sos-school.org) is an organisation whose mission is to help High School Students in Luxembourg guide Primary School Children through the Luxembourgish school system and share their personal experience with them.

### Working together with Caritas

We are partnered with [Caritas](https://www.caritas.lu), a non-profit supporting anyone in need of it in Luxembourg

### Feedback

We are yet in the early stages of getting our project up and running, hence feedback is much appreciated.
